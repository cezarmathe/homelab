# homelab

Cezar's homelab.

## History

Over the years I've always spent time managing some machines (mainly a raspberry
pi and then a server as well) for fun. I love operating servers, messing with
linux, that kind of stuff. I've had multiple repositories that tracked those
efforts, but they were either of poor quality or private (and will probably
stay private due to me storing secrets in git). This repository shall represent
my effort to consolidate all of my knowledge and experience with creating and
operating a homelab.

## Why

I want to own my own platform so that I can run services on it - either toy
projects I write myself or other cool stuff I may want to have (Gitea, Plex
etc).
